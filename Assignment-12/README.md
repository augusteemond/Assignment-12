Margin is the space outside of an element's border, while padding is the space inside of its border and borders are the area of play that contain the text, pictures, and padding.

2.)This Week I corrected what I was doing pertaining to images not showing up correctly on my web page. I specifically enjoyed this weeks assignment because of all the creative allowance we had. Im understanding the relationship between CSS and the webpage itself. A specific challenge I faced was the title of my web page is hidden behind the toolbar at the very top of the webpage. Other than this, this assignment went fairly smooth.
